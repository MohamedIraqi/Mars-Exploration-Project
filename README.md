Welcome to the Advanced Mars Mission Simulation Project repository. This project is a simulation of a Mars mission assignment system developed as part of a Data Structures and Algorithms course at Cairo University.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create a system that simulates the assignment of missions to different types of rovers on Mars. The system considers factors like mission types, rover capabilities, mission priorities, and more. It's designed to demonstrate proficiency in data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming.

## Features

- Formulation and assignment of missions to available rovers.
- Different mission types: Emergency, Mountainous, and Polar missions.
- Priority-based mission assignment criteria.
- Rover maintenance and checkup periods.
- Auto-promotion of missions to emergency status.
- Random mission failures (optional, as a bonus feature).

## Project Structure

- `src/` folder contains the C++ source code for the project.
- `input/` folder includes sample input files to simulate different scenarios.
- `output/` folder contains corresponding output files for the provided input.
- `images/` folder stores images used in the README.

## Getting Started

To run the simulation, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/MohamedIraqi/Mars-Exploration-Project`
2. Compile the C++ code using your preferred compiler.
3. Execute the compiled program with input files: `./mars-simulation input/inputfile.txt`

## Simulation Modes

- Interactive Mode: Allows you to monitor the simulation day by day.
- Step-By-Step Mode: Similar to interactive mode but with an automatic pause between days.
- Silent Mode: Generates output files without displaying the simulation steps.

## Sample Input and Output

You can find sample input and output files in the respective folders to test different scenarios.
